Hi, I’m Emily! I am a PhD candidate studying evolutionary genetics in the [Weber Lab](https://weberlab.integrativebiology.wisc.edu/) at UW-Madison. I am also part of the [Alaska Stickleback Project](https://alaskastickleback.com/), a large eco-evolution and restoration experiment. I’m fascinated by how phenotypic plasticity is shaped by evolution, and its subsequent impacts on ecology. I use the fish threespine stickleback to investigate evolved variation in plastic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and transcription. I plan to pursue an academic career and will be searching for postdocs upon graduating from UW-Madison.

Hi, I’m Emily! I am a PhD candidate at UW-Madison. I’m fascinated by how phenotypic plasticity can interact with evolution and ecology. I study the evolutionary genetics of a fish, threespine stickleback, to understand how plasticity can evolve and potentially influence resiliency. I plan to pursue an academic career, and will be searching for postdocs upon graduating from UW-Madison.

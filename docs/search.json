    "text": "Hi, I’m Emily! I am a PhD candidate studying evolutionary genetics in the Weber Lab at UW-Madison. I am also part of the Alaska Stickleback Project, a large eco-evolution and restoration experiment. I’m fascinated by how phenotypic plasticity is shaped by evolution, and its impacts on ecology. I use a fish, threespine stickleback, to investigate evolved variation in plastic mechanisms. I plan to pursue an academic career and will be searching for postdocs upon graduating from UW-Madison.\n\n\nCurriculum Vitae\nLast updated November 2024"

    "text": "Hi, I’m Emily! I am a PhD candidate studying evolutionary genetics in the Weber Lab at UW-Madison. I am also part of the Alaska Stickleback Project, a large eco-evolution and restoration experiment. I’m fascinated by how phenotypic plasticity is shaped by evolution, and its subsequent impacts on ecology. I use the fish threespine stickleback to investigate evolved variation in plastic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and transcription. I plan to pursue an academic career and will be searching for postdocs upon graduating from UW-Madison.\n\n\nCurriculum Vitae\nLast updated March 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLab Photo\n\n\n\n\n\nMoose and I"
